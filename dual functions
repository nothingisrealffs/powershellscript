.SYNOPSIS
Searches an in-memory list of AD computer objects for a specific computer name.

.PARAMETER ComputerName
The computer name to search for (exact match).
.EXAMPLE
$mem = Get-MemList
Search-MemList -MemList $mem -ComputerName "XXX"
This example loads the AD computers into memory, then searches for the computer named "XXX".

        [array]$MemList,
        [string]$ComputerName
    )
    $MemList | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq $ComputerName }
